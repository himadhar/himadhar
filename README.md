I am always driven by the fact that things can be better than what they are now - and possible only by acting on them. 
I am aware of my limitations and always try my best to overcome them either by upskilling or by circumventing around (if nothing works) to achieve my goals.
I have about 11 years of exposure to design and dev tools, and I intend to make its best.
